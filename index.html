It focuses on the differences in their syntax, highlighting that SCSS uses a syntax similar to standard CSS with curly braces and semicolons, while Sass employs an indented syntax without these elements. SCSS is easier for people to adapt to after using CSS the SASS because of the unusual syntax it uses. </p>

                            <p class="benefit__lead">SCSS contributes to efficiency in several ways. The biggest being the use of variables, because it allows you to store values such as colors and font sizes and repeatedly reuse them throughout your code without having to continuously type the same values. It also enables nesting which lets you write CSS rules that mirror your html structure making the code more organized and understandable creating more efficient coding. Another large contributor to efficiency is mixins, which allow you to create reusable blocks of CSS code. </p>

                            <h3 class="benefit__title">Reusability</h3>
                            <p class="benefit__lead">SSCSS contributes to reusability in similar ways as efficiency. The use of mixins and variables both create the opportunity for coders to not have the need to repeat redundant code. The use of reusing CSS code through mixins prevents the need to rewrite the same styles repeatedly, and the use of variables enables the reuse of values such as colors and sizes. The use of variables also ensures consistency throughout the code. </p>

                            <h3 class="benefit__title">Maintainability</h3>
                            <p class="benefit__lead">SCSS improves code maintainability by providing features that make stylesheets easier to manage. SCSS allows you to organize your code into separate and smaller files then CSS making it easier to find and change specific styles. The use of variables ensures that if a value needs to be changed, it only needs to be updated in one place, rather than throughout the entire stylesheet, reducing inconsistencies.</p>
